# Timesheet API Migration Workspace

This folder tracks the move of HubSpot workflow bypass tooling into the new AI-first Timesheet API repository.

## Contents
- `TIMESHEET_ASSET_DEPENDENCIES.md` – stage-by-stage dependency map from deal creation to billing.
- `SCRIPT_AUDIT.md` – catalogue of all timesheet/approval scripts with migration disposition.
- `MIGRATION_CLASSIFICATION.md` – runtime vs documentation vs historical asset guide.

## Usage
1. Update these docs as assets shift into the new repository.
2. Record open tasks and parity test status before disabling code in the legacy repo.
3. Drop additional migration notes or trackers here to keep the main repo tidy while we transition.
