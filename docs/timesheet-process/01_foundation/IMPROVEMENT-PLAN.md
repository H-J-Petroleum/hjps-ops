# Foundations Improvement Plan (Legacy Path)

This placeholder keeps legacy references intact. The maintained improvement plan lives under the generated phase documentation:

- [Phase 01 Improvement Plan](../phases/01-foundation/docs/IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md)
- [Strategic Execution Hub](../../../docs/strategy/index.md)

Update or regenerate the plan via the phases/ structure so shared tooling remains in sync.
