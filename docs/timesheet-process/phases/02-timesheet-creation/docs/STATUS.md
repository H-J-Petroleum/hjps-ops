# Phase 02 - Timesheet Creation â€“ Documentation Status

Last updated: 2025-09-19

## Delivered Artefacts

- TRACE map across portal modules, WF-10/11/12 automation, and approval handoff
- DATA-ARCHITECTURE and METHODS comparison updated for timesheet arrays and portal objects
- UI/UX recommendations covering portal states, navigation, polling behaviour, accessibility
- Improvement plan logging workflow gaps (update/delete coverage, delegated edits)
- Agent guides per subprocess aligned with consultant portal responsibilities

## Gaps To Fill

| Subprocess | Outstanding Items |
| --- | --- |
| `portal-management` | Document workflow exports for timesheet update/delete paths and confirm automation IDs |
| `approval-handoff` | Clarify WF-08/WF-09 expectations for submitted timesheet arrays and add test evidence |
| `data-quality` | Add regression checks for cg_* array parsing and delegated timesheet contact scenarios |

## Next Actions

1. Export and archive WF-11, WF-12, and any supporting webhooks before the next doc refresh
2. Capture screenshots of portal navigation (Step 0-4) and thread them into the overview
3. Extend verification script to validate timesheet status transitions and portal lock rules
