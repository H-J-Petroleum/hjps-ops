# Timesheet Creation Phase Overview

Phase 02 covers consultant-facing portal access, timesheet line-item creation, and the handoff into the approval engine.

## Key Documents
- Trace: `TRACE.md`
- Data architecture: `DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- UI/UX recommendations: `UI-UX-RECOMMENDATIONS.md`
- Methods comparison: `METHODS-COMPARISON.md`
- Improvement plan: `IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md`

## Subprocess Folders
- `project_configuration`: portal entry and WF-10 staging.
- `approver_assignment`: dashboard actions and approval handoff forms.
- `company_associations`: mapping timesheets to projects, wells, and deals.
- `data_relationships`: schema/association catalog for timesheet objects.
- `workflow_configuration`: WF-11 creation and WF-12 cleanup details.

Each subprocess folder mirrors Phase 01 structure (`assets/`, `properties/`, `workflows/`, `issues/`, `tools/`) to keep agent automation consistent.

## Verification
