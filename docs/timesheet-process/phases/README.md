# Timesheet Process Phases

This directory hosts the generated documentation for each process phase. Start from the strategic view, then dive into the specific phase folders.

- [Strategic Execution Hub](../../../docs/strategy/index.md)
- Phase 01: 01-foundation/
- Phase 02: 02-timesheet-creation/
- Phase 03: 03-approval/
- Phase 04: 04-billing/
- Phase 05: (pending)

Each phase folder follows the shared structure (docs/, agents/, verification/) produced by scripts/agent-core/generate-phase-docs.js.
