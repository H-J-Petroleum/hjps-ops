# Workflow Configuration (Foundations) Overview

During the Foundations phase there are **no dedicated automation workflows** that run inside HubSpot; all heavy approval sequencing begins in the next phase (`phases/03-approval`).

The purpose of this folder is to confirm which assets will be handed off:
- Foundations ensures project and association data are clean (see Project Configuration & Company Associations).
- Approval-stage workflows (e.g., Consultant Approval Request, reminders) remain disabled here and are documented under `analysis/timesheet_process/phases/03-approval/`.

Use this folder to capture any prep tasks needed before enabling those downstream workflows. If no changes are required, note that the subprocess is “handoff only”.
