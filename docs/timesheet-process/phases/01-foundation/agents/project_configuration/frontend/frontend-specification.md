# Project Configuration Frontend Documentation

## Overview
The project configuration experience lives in HubSpot CMS and CRM record pages. It delivers the consultant handoff flow, well creation prompts, and validation feedback from WF-03 so sales users can resolve blockers before approvals.

## Key Interfaces

### 1. Consultant Assignment Portal (modules `hjp-assign-consultant-to-new-deal-01/02/03`)
- **Data sources:** Deal properties `assign_consultant_to_a_new_sales_deal`, `link_for_consultant`, and consultant metadata from WF-01.
- **Features:** Step-by-step wizard guiding consultant confirmation, approver reminder, and final well creation link.
- **Validation:** Displays WF-03 error messages when `missing_important_info` is true; blocks progression until issues are resolved.

### 2. Project Setup CRM Card
- **Location:** Custom right-sidebar card on the sales deal record.
- **Fields surfaced:** Approver status, operator/customer associations, last WF-03 run timestamp, link to well creation.
- **Actions:** Quick buttons to re-run WF-03 (stage nudge) and to open the consultant assignment portal.

### 3. Well Creation Prompt (`create_associate_well` link)
- **Data sources:** Output of WF-03; deep links into CMS page hosting the well forms.
- **Behaviour:** Only shown once WF-03 passes; includes checklist reminding users to ensure operator/customer associations exist.

## Form Validation
- Validate hidden IDs in the consultant assignment form before submission; show inline errors when tokens are missing.
- Display alert banners on the CRM card when `missing_important_info = Yes` with actionable remediation steps.
- After well creation, prompt user to refresh the deal so company association workflows can run.

## User Experience Guidelines
- Present success/failure states at each step (consultant confirmed, approver validated, wells linked).
- Provide direct links to CRM associations so users can edit contacts/companies without leaving the flow.
- Ensure all links generated by WF-01/WF-03 open in new tabs to preserve the sales deal context for re-enrolment.
