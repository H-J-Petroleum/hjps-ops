# Foundation Process Overview

*Phase 1 of the timesheet management system - Project setup and configuration*

## üéØ **Process Purpose**

The foundation process establishes the groundwork for the entire timesheet system by:
1. **Creating and configuring projects** with proper settings
2. **Assigning approvers** (internal H&J staff or external customers)
3. **Setting up company associations** and relationships
4. **Configuring approval workflows** and business rules
5. **Establishing data relationships** between all objects

```

## üìä **Key Components**

### **Project Management**
- **Project Creation:** New project setup with all required fields
- **Project Configuration:** Settings, rules, and business logic
- **Project Status:** Active, inactive, or archived states
- **Project Validation:** Ensure all required data is present

### **Approver Assignment**
- **Internal Approvers:** H&J staff members
- **External Approvers:** Customer contacts
- **Approver Validation:** Email and contact verification
- **Approval Routing:** Logic for routing to correct approver

### **Company Associations**
- **Company Linking:** Associate projects with companies
- **Contact Management:** Link consultants and approvers
- **Deal Integration:** Connect projects to sales deals
- **Relationship Validation:** Ensure proper associations

### **Workflow Configuration**
- **Approval Rules:** Define approval requirements
- **Notification Settings:** Configure email and alerts
- **Escalation Logic:** Set up escalation paths
- **Business Rules:** Define validation and processing rules

## üîó **Integration Points**

### **Next Process**
- **Phase 2:** [Timesheet Creation](../02_timesheet_creation/overview.md)

### **Related Processes**
- **Phase 3:** [Approval Process](../03-approval/docs/overview.md)
- **Phase 4:** [Billing Process](../04_billing/overview.md)
- **Cross-Phase:** [Notifications Summary](../../../shared/notifications/TODO.md)

## üìã **Key Assets**

### **Objects**
- **HJ Projects (2-118270518):** Main project object
- **Contact (0-1):** Consultants and approvers
- **Company (0-2):** Customer companies
- **Deal (0-3):** Sales deals and opportunities

### **Properties**
- **Project Properties:** Name, status, approver information
- **Approver Properties:** Email, name, type (internal/external)
- **Association Properties:** Company and contact relationships
- **Configuration Properties:** Settings and business rules

### **Workflows**
- **Project Creation Workflow:** Automated project setup
- **Approver Assignment Workflow:** Assign and validate approvers
- **Association Workflow:** Create and manage relationships
- **Validation Workflow:** Ensure data integrity

## üö® **Common Issues**

1. **Missing Approver Information:** Projects without assigned approvers
2. **Invalid Email Addresses:** Approver emails that don't work
3. **Broken Associations:** Missing or incorrect company/contact links
4. **Configuration Errors:** Incorrect business rules or settings

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] All projects have complete configuration
- [ ] Approvers are properly assigned and validated
- [ ] Company associations are correctly established
- [ ] Workflow configurations are accurate
- [ ] Data relationships are properly maintained

## üìå **Documentation Status Gate**

- [x] `project_configuration` ‚Äì backend guide, property mapping, frontend notes
- [ ] `scope_management` ‚Äì consolidate scope creation + approval flows (documentation freshly added, testing pending)
- [x] `approver_assignment` ‚Äì process overview, backend/front-end outlines, workflow summary
- [ ] `company_associations` ‚Äì needs backend/association documentation and property map
- [ ] `data_relationships` ‚Äì needs relationship mapping, validation checklist
- [ ] `workflow_configuration` ‚Äì needs workflow catalogue, configuration runbook

> Only flip Phase 01 to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù after every unchecked item above has the documented artefacts in place.

## üîß **Backend Implementation**

### **Core Logic**
- **Project Creation:** Validate and create project records
- **Approver Management:** Assign and validate approvers
- **Association Management:** Create and maintain relationships
- **Configuration Management:** Set up business rules and settings

### **Data Validation**
- **Required Fields:** Ensure all mandatory data is present
- **Email Validation:** Verify approver email addresses
- **Association Validation:** Check relationship integrity
- **Business Rule Validation:** Enforce company policies

### **Error Handling**
- **Validation Errors:** Clear error messages for missing data
- **Association Errors:** Handle broken relationships
- **Configuration Errors:** Fix incorrect settings
- **Recovery Logic:** Restore from backup if needed
