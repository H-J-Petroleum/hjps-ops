## Gaps To Fill

| Subprocess | Outstanding Items |
| --- | --- |
| `scope_management` | Capture end-to-end QA evidence for the consultant scope flow (WF-01 -> CMS -> WF-09) and document acceptance steps |
| `company_associations` | Schedule recurring runs of tools/validate_wf04_wf05.py and archive execution logs in shared verification |
| `data_relationships` | Refresh schema exports and add a regression checklist that flags association/property drift |
| `workflow_configuration` | Pull workflow exports from Phase 03 and document the activation plan for foundations-era prerequisites |
| `cross-phase` | Align the overview checklist and global structure summary once validation artefacts are in place |

## Next Actions

1. Fold the WF-04/WF-05 validation script into the QA cadence and track results in verification logs
2. Document the scope authoring + approval path, including WF-09 outputs and supporting evidence
3. Refresh association/property exports and update the comprehensive process map if relationships shift
