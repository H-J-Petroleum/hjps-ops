# Foundation Phase Status (2025-09-18)

This status report replaces the automated "completion" export. It reflects the current documentation and implementation readiness for Phase 01.

## Summary
- **Overall state:** In progress ‚Äî core docs now exist for all subprocesses, but company associations/data relationships/workflow configuration still need deeper validation coverage.
- **Primary blockers:** Operationalise the new WF-04/WF-05 validation check, keep schema exports current, complete mappings for the consultant talent pipeline and upcoming timesheet phase, and align global status reporting once validation parity is achieved.
- **Immediate priority:** Roll the new validation/tooling into regular QA runs, validate the scope workflow end-to-end, and keep schema exports in sync for downstream phases.

## Subprocess Snapshot
| Subprocess | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project Configuration | ‚úÖ Functional docs | Backend guide and context extract are authoritative; monitor URL mappings.
| Scope Management | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | New documentation in place; need functional tests covering CMS flow and WF-09 lifecycle.
| Approver Assignment | ‚úÖ Functional docs | Backend guide, property map, and workflow inventory present; continue tracking form validation.
| Company Associations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Artefacts now recorded; still need automated tests for WF-04/WF-05 outputs.
| Data Relationships | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Association inventory documented; add regression checklist for schema drift.
| Workflow Configuration | üìù Handoff | Inventories captured; awaiting workflow exports and activation plan from Phase 03.

## Outstanding Work (Carry To TODOs)
1. Integrate the new `validate_wf04_wf05.py` check into the release/QA cadence and capture execution history.
2. Exercise the scope authoring + approval flow end-to-end (WF-01 ‚Üí CMS ‚Üí WF-09) and document acceptance steps.
3. Produce the detailed consultant talent pipeline guide and begin parity mapping for the Timesheet (Phase 02) process.
4. Schedule regular schema export refresh (data_relationships) and record results.
5. Update `STRUCTURE-STATUS-SUMMARY.md` when validation coverage matches Project Configuration and Approver Assignment.
