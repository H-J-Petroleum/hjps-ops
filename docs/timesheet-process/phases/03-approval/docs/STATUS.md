## Gaps To Fill

| Subprocess | Outstanding Items |
| --- | --- |
| `request_for_approval` | Confirm workflow 567500453 enrollment matches updated form parameters and capture screenshots in verification plan. |
| `approve_reject` | Sync internal (1682422902) vs external (1680618036) decision workflows and document status change evidence. |
| `re_approval_request` | Add reminder cadence/run history for workflows 567466561 & 567463273 to the verification checklist. |

## Next Actions

1. Export latest approval workflows into data/raw/workflows and link the run history from verification logs.
2. Embed approval interface screenshots in docs/overview.md to clarify internal vs external paths.
3. Coordinate with notifications phase to document outbound approval emails and escalation rules.
