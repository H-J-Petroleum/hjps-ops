# Cross-Phase Notifications Summary

Notifications span every phase. Use this checklist to document and verify them.

## Phase Touchpoints
- **Phase 01 – Foundations:** capture approver contact metadata, escalation day settings, and Teams alert prerequisites.
- **Phase 02 – Timesheet Creation:** log submission confirmations, failure alerts, and portal status messaging.
- **Phase 03 – Approval:** document reminder cadence, escalation workflows, and outbound approval emails.
- **Phase 04 – Billing:** (pending) add invoice delivery notifications and payment reminders once billing flow is authored.

## Shared Tasks
- Catalogue notification workflows and templates (IDs, owners, targets).
- Track SLA expectations and escalation paths in one place.
- Store sample payloads/logs for verification and troubleshooting.
- Coordinate changes with shared/source/phases.json so generated docs stay in sync.

**Status:** TODO – fill in details as each phase documents its notification behaviour.
