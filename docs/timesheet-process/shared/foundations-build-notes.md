# Foundations Build Notes

## 2025-09-19 (Phase 02 Timesheet Creation)
- Authored Phase 02 trace, data architecture, UI/UX, methods comparison, and improvement plan files under analysis/timesheet_process/phases/02-timesheet-creation/.
- Populated subprocess folders (project_configuration, approver_assignment, company_associations, data_relationships, workflow_configuration) with assets/properties/workflows/issues/tools to mirror Phase 01 structure.
- Ran verification script: log stored at analysis/timesheet_process/phases/02-timesheet-creation/verification/logs/phase-verification-20250919T153133Z.md.
- Next: extend Phase 02 update workflow documentation once the HubSpot export is available and integrate the shared custom-coded URL/token workflow action when ready.

Use this log to capture what worked, what failed, and outstanding follow-ups while we document the Foundations phase.

## 2025-09-18
- Locked project configuration docs to Workflow 01/03 scope; removed downstream approval references.
- Capture module metadata via `extract_project_configuration_context.py`; consultant assignment modules still have zero field definitions (confirm if expected when rebuilding).
- Missing workflow exports for IDs 1680618036 / 1682422902; rerun HubSpot exporter before tackling approval response docs.
- Next up: Approver Assignment — extract association labels and workflow IDs before drafting docs.

_Add new entries as you work through each subprocess so the orchestration loop knows current state and blockers._

## 2025-09-18 (cont.)
- Drafted approver_assignment overview/agent/backend using workflows 01,03,06; currently placeholders for verification.
- WF-06 JSON export missing full workflow-* file; rerun exporter to capture actions for documentation QA.
- Drafted company_associations docs using workflows 04/05; need full workflow exports if only v4-flow files present.

## 2025-09-18 (ACTUALLY RESOLVED) ✅
- **WORKFLOW DATA INVESTIGATION COMPLETE** ✅
- **Root Cause:** `data/raw/workflows/` directory was completely empty + pagination issues
- **Resolution:** Created and ran pagination-aware export script (`complete-workflow-export.ps1`)
- **Results:** 
  - Exported **247 v4 Platform Flows** (complete inventory - was limited to 100 due to pagination)
  - **FOUND TARGET WORKFLOWS:**
    - 1680618036: "21. Customer Approval Response (Approval)" - **ENABLED** ✅
    - 1682422902: "26. H&J Approval Response (Approval)" - **ENABLED** ✅
    - 567438978: "26. H&J Approval Response" - **DISABLED** (legacy version)
  - All workflow data now available in `data/raw/workflows/`
- **Status:** Issue fully resolved - both target workflows found and exported
- Workflow configuration: confirmed no Foundations workflows; documented handoff instructions.
- Data relationships docs created with association ID table; regenerate schema extract after updates.

## 2025-09-18 (Structure Audit)
- Phase 01 directories cleaned: removed 100+ empty placeholder folders so only documented content remains.
- Moved all agent execution/status artefacts into `analysis/timesheet_process/shared/agents/`; foundation folders now hold curated guidance only.
- Added `01_foundation/STATUS.md` plus checklist in `overview.md` to block premature "complete" status.
- `STRUCTURE-STATUS-SUMMARY.md` and top-level `README.md` now flag Phase 01 as partial coverage; phases 02/04/05 marked as placeholders.
- Follow-up: author backend + property docs for `company_associations`, `data_relationships`, `workflow_configuration` before reopening deep folder scaffolding.

## 2025-09-18 (Workflow Export & Validation)
- Re-exported approval workflows 1680618036 and 1682422902; cleared warning in generated project configuration context.
- Added `validate_wf04_wf05.py` automated check for well association workflows; initial run passed (IDs 126/128 detected).
- Documented validation steps and tooling in company associations subprocess.

## 2025-09-18 (Scope Management Build)
- Introduced `scope_management/` subprocess: overview, asset inventory, property map, workflow sequence, tooling, and issues log.
- Folded scope URL (`scope_of_work_and_pricing`) into project configuration property tables so WF-01 Action 3 is represented end-to-end.
- Documented WF-09 Scope of Work – Approval and CMS flows (`prepare-consultants-*`, `approve-scope-of-work-*`) in the Foundations trace.
- TODO: Execute full scope creation → approval run (WF-01 → CMS → WF-09) and capture results for agents.

## 2025-09-18 (Data Architecture Recommendations)
- Authored `DATA-ARCHITECTURE.md` with object/property/association map and modernization recommendations.
- Expanded `METHODS-COMPARISON.md` to include per-asset method tables for workflows, modules, forms, and URLs.
- Updated agent quick-start guidance to reference new data architecture expectations before code generation.

## 2025-09-18 (UI/UX Architecture Pass)
- Created `UI-UX-RECOMMENDATIONS.md` documenting all consultant/scope/well modules, forms, and UI patterns.
- Highlighted inconsistent styling, duplicated JS, and property-driven CTAs; proposed shared CSS/JS and CRM card strategy.
- Noted follow-up tasks to build shared assets and accessibility checklist for Foundations flows.

## 2025-09-18 (Consolidated Improvement Plan)
- Authored `IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` capturing data, UI/UX, and automation recommendations plus consultant talent pipeline dependency.
- Flagged follow-up items: document recruiting pipeline stages, prototype shared URL service, refactor CMS modules incrementally.
- Added roadmap items to finish mapping the Timesheet (Phase 02) process and build the talent pipeline guide in the same format as Foundations trace.
- Prepared `FOUNDATIONS-VERIFICATION-PLAN.md` and shared `shared/verification/verify_phase.py` for reusable trace validation before advancing to Phase 02.
- Latest log (`analysis/timesheet_process/phases/01-foundation/verification/logs/foundations-verification-20250919T133317Z.md`) confirms trace vs exports (workflows/modules/properties) with no outstanding discrepancies.
