# Agent Artefact Archive

Automation outputs (status JSON, PowerShell execution scripts, prompt packs) are stored here so that phase folders remain focused on curated documentation.

- `foundation/` â€“ artefacts generated for Phase 01 subprocess agents (approver assignment, company associations, data relationships, project configuration, workflow configuration).
- Future phases should follow the same pattern: move generated files here and link back from the relevant status notes instead of leaving them in documentation subdirectories.

> When adding new agent outputs, create or reuse the phase-specific subfolder and keep only the curated guidance (`agent.md`, implementation notes, etc.) alongside the process documentation.
