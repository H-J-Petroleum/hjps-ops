# PDF Approval Summary Normalization – Review Notes
_Drafted: 2025-10-01_

## Overview
- Service Summary and Well Breakdown tables now display `Qty` with the proper unit suffix (e.g., `Mileage (mi)`), matching the detailed line items.
- All quantity and currency values are formatted via shared helpers (`ValueFormattingService`) so output is consistent across PDFs and API consumers.
- The Approval API’s PDF bridge reuses the formatter, exposing `quantityFormatted`, `unitDisplay`, and `totalAmountFormatted` to any downstream integrations.
- `Fee/One Time` style services normalize to the `one-time fee` unit, eliminating the unresolved category in the HubSpot dataset.

## Key Touchpoints
- `src/pdf-generator/src/services/valueFormattingService.js` – alias map, smart quantity/currency helpers.
- `src/pdf-generator/src/services/dataProcessingService.js` – aggregates retain raw + formatted values, label services with units.
- `src/pdf-generator/src/services/tableRenderingService.js` – renders `Qty` headers using preformatted strings.
- `src/approval-api/src/services/pdfIntegrationService.js` – enriched payload for PDF requests and any CSV/API reuse.
- `analysis/issues/2025-10-01-pdf-approval-summary-units/scripts/fetch-timesheet-units.js` – HubSpot data pull confirming real-world unit coverage (9,330 records, no unresolved entries).

## Tests / Validation
Run from repo root unless noted:
- `npm --prefix config run test:pdf`
- `npm --prefix src/approval-api test -- pdfIntegrationService`
- Optional: `node analysis/issues/2025-10-01-pdf-approval-summary-units/scripts/fetch-timesheet-units.js` (requires `.hubspot-token`) to re-verify unit mapping against live data.

## Rollout Guidance
1. Generate a sample approval PDF (customer & consultant) and confirm:
   - Service Summary / Well Breakdown show `Qty` and unit suffixes.
   - `one-time fee` rows render as `Service (one-time fee)` with integer quantities.
   - Totals display as `$x.xx`.
2. Spot-check Approval API responses (or logged payloads) to ensure the new `quantityFormatted`, `unitDisplay`, and `totalAmountFormatted` fields appear when PDF generation runs.
3. Update any dashboards or CSV exports to prefer the formatted fields (if they still rely on raw quantities).
4. Communicate the new presentation to approvers so they know quantity units may differ (miles, days, one-time fees).

## Risks & Follow‑ups
- Historical PDFs generated outside this build will still lack the unit labeling; reruns may be needed for high-visibility approvals.
- Monitor HubSpot exports for new frequency phrases (extend `UNIT_ALIASES` if needed).
- Capture regression tests for other downstream consumers once they adopt the formatted fields.
